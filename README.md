# 2016 Freshman Survey

Early this September, _The Phillipian_, vol. CXXXIX, and _The Exonian_, vol. CXXXVIII, collaborated to conduct the first-ever survey of all incoming freshmen at Andover and Exeter. The survey, inspired by the annual “Freshman Survey” distributed by “The Harvard Crimson” and “The Yale Daily News,” consists of 36 questions and is divided into five main topics: general information, middle school, Andover/Exeter, and perceptions about the two institutions academically, socially, and athletically.

Of the 221 Juniors (freshmen at Andover) who received the survey, _The Phillipian_ received 169 complete responses – 76.5 percent of the Class of 2020\. Of the 186 Preps (freshmen at Exeter) who received the survey, _The Exonian_ received 157 complete responses – 84.4 percent of students polled. In the interest of accurately reporting the results of the two surveys, all of the data is presented on a percentage basis and all graphs can be toggled to show individual results from each school.

We thank the students at Andover and Exeter for their willingness to provide information about themselves and to share their experiences, and we are looking forward to future collaborations between _The Phillipian_ and _The Exonian_ under the joint _Non Sibi Press_ masthead.

_Editor’s Note: In the interest of releasing the survey as timely as possible, this website went live before_ The Exonian _had concluded their interviews of Exeter students. The website will be updated in due time._
